The\n","design of Flower is based on a few guiding principles:\n","\n","* **Customizable**: Federated learning systems vary wildly from one use case to\n","  another. Flower allows for a wide range of different configurations depending\n","  on the needs of each individual use case.\n","\n","* **Extendable**: Flower originated from a research project at the University of\n","  Oxford, so it was built with AI research in mind. Many components can be\n","  extended and overridden to build new state-of-the-art systems.\n","\n","* **Framework-agnostic**: Different machine learning frameworks have different\n","  strengths. Flower can be used with any machine learning framework, for\n","  example, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org),\n","  [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org), [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/), [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/), [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/), [TFLite](https://tensorflow.org/lite/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",") for federated analytics, or even raw [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)\n","  for users who enjoy computing gradients by hand.\n","\n","* **Understandable**: Flower is written with maintainability in mind.

Check out Python versions supporting both TensorFlow and Flower. ([Flower's](https://flower.dev/docs/installation.html#python-version) and [TensorFlow's](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) requirements) \n","\n","2. Create a virtual environment using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or other tools. Let's say you use Anaconda. \n","\n","```shell\n","conda create -n flwr python # you can specify a Python version: \"python\" => \"python=3.10\"\n","```\n","\n","3. Activate that environemnt.\n","\n","```shell\n","conda activate flwr\n","```\n","\n","4. Install TensorFlow and Flower\n","\n","```shell\n","# Install Tensorflow\n","# Check out https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip for latest instruction\n","# You may need to change codatoolkit and cudnn version depending on your setup and any future change to TensorFlow\n","conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0\n","export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/\n","python3 -m pip install tensorflow\n","# Verify install:\n","python3 -c \"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))\"\n","\n","# Install Flower\n","pip install flwr\n","```\n","\n","And we are good to go!\n","\n","### Design server and clients\n","\n","Flower has made this step very easy. \n","\n","#### Clients\n","\n","Create a file `client.py`. And in that file, write\n","\n","```python\n","import flwr as fl\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","```\n","\n","to import the required modules. \n","\n","After that, let's load the famous [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset to do a simple image classification job. \n","\n","```python\n","(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n","```\n","\n","For the model, let's use [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381), a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that seeks to perform well on mobile devices, with 10 output classes.\n","\n","```python\n","model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2((32, 32, 3), classes=10, weights=None)\n","model.compile(\"adam\", \"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"])\n","```\n","\n","![mnv2](https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/Screen_Shot_2020-06-06_at_10.37.14_PM.png)\n","\n","The Flower server interacts with clients through an interface called `Client`. When the server selects a particular client for training, it sends training instructions over the network. The client receives those instructions and calls one of the `Client` methods to run your code (i.e., to train the neural network we defined earlier).\n","\n","Flower provides a convenience class called `NumPyClient` which makes it easier to implement the `Client` interface when your workload uses Keras. The `NumPyClient` interface defines three methods which can be implemented in the following way:\n","\n","```python\n","class CifarClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):\n","    def get_parameters(self, config):\n","        return model.get_weights()\n","\n","    def fit(self, parameters, config):\n","        model.set_weights(parameters)\n","        model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1, batch_size=32, steps_per_epoch=3)\n","        return model.get_weights(), len(x_train), {}\n","\n","    def evaluate(self, parameters, config):\n","        model.set_weights(parameters)\n","        loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)\n","        return loss, len(x_test), {\"accuracy\": float(accuracy)}\n","```\n","\n","Now create an instance of our class CifarClient and add one line to actually run this client:\n","\n","```python\n","fl.client.start_numpy_client(server_address=\"[::]:8080\", client=CifarClient())\n","```\n","\n","The string `\"[::]:8080\"` tells the client which server to connect to. In our case we can run the server and the client on the same machine, therefore we use `\"[::]:8080\"`. If we run a truly federated workload with the server and clients running on different machines, all that needs to change is the `server_address` we point the client at.\n","\n","#### Server\n","\n","Server setup is even easier as Flower has simplified more for us. Create a file `server.py` and in that file:\n","\n","```python\n","import flwr as fl\n","\n","fl.server.start_server(config=fl.server.ServerConfig(num_rounds=3))\n","```\n","\n","### Train the model\n","\n","1. Start the server:\n","\n","```shell\n","python server.py\n","```\n","\n","2. In a different terminal sessions, run\n","\n","```shell\n","$ python client.py\n","```\n","\n","to start a first client and in another terminal session run the same code for a second one.\n","\n","Voilà! FL has started. You should be able to see in the server terminal:\n","\n","```shell\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:15:46,741 | app.py:76 | Flower server running (insecure, 3 rounds)\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:15:46,742 | server.py:72 | Getting initial parameters\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:16:01,770 | server.py:74 | Evaluating initial parameters\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:16:01,770 | server.py:87 | [TIME] FL starting\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:16:12,341 | server.py:165 | fit_round: strategy sampled 2 clients (out of 2)\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:21:17,235 | server.py:177 | fit_round received 2 results and 0 failures\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:21:17,512 | server.py:139 | evaluate: strategy sampled 2 clients\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:21:29,628 | server.py:149 | evaluate received 2 results and 0 failures\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:21:29,696 | server.py:165 | fit_round: strategy sampled 2 clients (out of 2)\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:25:59,917 | server.py:177 | fit_round received 2 results and 0 failures\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:26:00,227 | server.py:139 | evaluate: strategy sampled 2 clients\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:26:11,457 | server.py:149 | evaluate received 2 results and 0 failures\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:26:11,530 | server.py:165 | fit_round: strategy sampled 2 clients (out of 2)\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:30:43,389 | server.py:177 | fit_round received 2 results and 0 failures\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:30:43,630 | server.py:139 | evaluate: strategy sampled 2 clients\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,384 | server.py:149 | evaluate received 2 results and 0 failures\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,384 | server.py:122 | [TIME] FL finished in 891.6143046000007\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,385 | app.py:109 | app_fit: losses_distributed [(1, 2.3196680545806885), (2, 2.3202896118164062), (3, 2.1818180084228516)]\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,385 | app.py:110 | app_fit: accuracies_distributed []\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,385 | app.py:111 | app_fit: losses_centralized []\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,385 | app.py:112 | app_fit: accuracies_centralized []\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:30:53,442 | server.py:139 | evaluate: strategy sampled 2 clients\n","DEBUG flower 2021-02-25 14:31:02,848 | server.py:149 | evaluate received 2 results and 0 failures\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:31:02,848 | app.py:121 | app_evaluate: federated loss: 2.1818180084228516\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:31:02,848 | app.py:125 | app_evaluate: results [('ipv4:127.0.0.1:57158', EvaluateRes(loss=2.1818180084228516, num_examples=10000, accuracy=0.0, metrics={'accuracy': 0.21610000729560852})), ('ipv4:127.0.0.1:57160', EvaluateRes(loss=2.1818180084228516, num_examples=10000, accuracy=0.0, metrics={'accuracy': 0.21610000729560852}))]\n","INFO flower 2021-02-25 14:31:02,848 | app.py:127 | app_evaluate: failures [] flower 2020-07-15 10:07:56,396 | app.py:77 | app_evaluate: failures []\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"D-JM_dWvwDMx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Further reading and experiments\n","\n","- [Flower documentation](https://flower.dev/docs/)\n","\n","- [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n","\n","- [MobileNetV2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)\n","\n","- [TensorFlow Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated)\n","\n","- [FATE](https://fate.fedai.org/)\n","\n","- [IBM FL](https://ibmfl.mybluemix.net/)"],"metadata":{"id":"z6UoPApj6xSB"}}]}
